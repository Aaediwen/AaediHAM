This is my attempt at re-implementing the idea behind HamClock from Clear Sky Institute as an SDL application eventually with versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux from the same code base.
The map images used here are the Blue Marble and Earth at Night images from NASA.  The call sign is currently hard coded in this very early version, until I get far enough to implement a config file.
